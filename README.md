# Buoyant Epithelial Culture Devices

This is the Github page for the BECD system, as will hopefully be published by Hewitt et al. This is a two-part, 3D printed system which is designed for use in a standard size 6 well culture plate.
The BECD automatically induces the air-liquid interface when filled with a collagen-fibroblast hydrogel and topped with keratinocytes, which leads to epithelial stratification.
These devices are buoyant and self-levelling, so no time-consuming manual adjustment of media levels are required. These devices are also significantly cheaper than standard culture inserts.

Please contact the authors of the paper if you require further advice with printing BECDS.
